# future-code

Elia Labs is a personal innovation space where ideas come to life through code.  
Itâ€™s a place for building intelligent systems, testing futuristic concepts, and learning everything from classical computer science to the frontiers of artificial consciousness.

Here, creativity meets logic.  
Every repository is an experiment, a dream in motion, or a step toward something revolutionary.

Fueled by ambition, driven by obsession.  
This lab belongs to the future.
